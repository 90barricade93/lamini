This is the repo for the Lamini project, which aims to build and share an instruction-following model with CC-BY license that allows commercial use. The repo contains:

- The [52K data](#data-release) used for fine-tuning the model.
- The code for [generating the data](#data-generation-process).

### Authentication to Lamini

Ready to configure your API key? It's easy-peasy! 🔑

First, navigate to your [Lamini account page](https://app.powerml.co) to retrieve your unique API key. Remember to keep this key a secret, and don't expose it in any client-side code or share it with others.

Next, create a config file, like so:

```
mkdir ~/.powerml
touch ~/.powerml/configure_llama.yaml # backend system names
```

Finally, open the file with a text editor and place your key in it:

```
production:
    key: "<YOUR-KEY-HERE>"
```

The best part? The [Lamini python package](https://pypi.org/project/llama-llm) will automatically load your key from this config file for you, so you don't have to worry about it. 🙌

If you're running Lamini in a docker container, make sure to copy/mount this file inside the container. 🐳

See our [API docs](https://powerml.github.io/auth/) for more details.

### Run 
Clone the repository
```
git clone git@github.com:lamini-ai/lamini.git

```

#### Using Docker 🐳

Make sure you have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed.

Then, run this command:

```bash
./run_generate_data_docker.sh
```

It's poggers 💥

## Data Release 💸 

[`data/lamini_dataset.json`](./data/lamini_dataset.json) contains 52K instruction-following data we generated for commercial use (ie. feel free to use it for your business! 💰📈).
This JSON file is a list of dictionaries, each dictionary contains the following fields:

- `question`: `str`, describes the task the model should perform. Each of the 52K instructions is unique.
- `response`: `str`, the answer to the instruction as generated by `lamini/instruct`.
